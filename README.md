This is a flutter code that i made for my Final Practical Training exam.
The code is about getting value from an API and then sending the value to the app.

which then make it able to operate and get all of it's value which then will be shown to the app.
For the app to work, you'll need internet connection, since it's using an online API, not a local ones.

## Getting Started

create new flutter project,
and then replace all the file inside your "lib" directory with mine.
and copy and paste the dependencies needed from pubspec.yaml

*if you're too lazy to do that, here's the dependencies tha you'll need. Just copy and paste it into your pubspec.yaml under the "dependencies"

> http:  ^0.13.4

> google_fonts:  ^2.1.0

*This is what's supposed to be in your pubspec.yaml, although you may use different flutter SDK environment version

This is the SDK version that i use:
